## 🎬 What is Local Subtitle Editor?

**Local Subtitle Editor** is a powerful, standalone subtitle editor that runs entirely in your browser. It's a single HTML file and two js-libraries that requires no installation, no server, and no internet connection.

This tool is designed for videographers, translators, and anyone who needs a fast, private, and efficient way to create, edit, and sync subtitles for video or audio. Forget bulky software—just open the file and start working.

## ✨ Highlights

-   **Fully Local & Private:** All your files (video, audio, subtitles) are processed exclusively on your machine. No data is ever sent anywhere.
-   **Zero Installation:** Simply download a single HTML file and open it in your browser. That's it.
-   **Visual Editor with Audio Waveform:** An interactive waveform lets you create, move, and adjust subtitle timings with incredible precision using your mouse. Zoom and pan are fully supported.
-   **Smart Text Automation:** Includes built-in functions for automatic line wrapping (based on character limits) and splitting long subtitles, similar to professional-grade editors.
-   **Popular Format Support:** Easily import and export files in **SRT** and **VTT** formats. You can also save the text content as plain **TXT** or **CSV**.
-   **Advanced Editing Tools:**
    -   Undo/Redo history for all major actions.
    -   Find & Replace across all subtitles.
    -   Drag-and-drop to reorder cues.
    -   Hotkeys for a faster workflow.
-   **Modern UI:** A comfortable dark theme, a responsive layout, and intuitive controls make for a pleasant editing experience.
